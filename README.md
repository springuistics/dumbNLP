I have several projects that are essentially unfunded, so I can't get proper server space. Therefore, I need a simple, callable, JS that can perform a bunch of functions without having to install NPM or initialize an LLM or anything like that.

This is why I created dumbNLP. Some people have told me it's a dumb idea and isn't as good as most parsers. I know. I agree. But it is free, it is fast, and it is one simple line of code to add a bunch of decent enough NLP calculations.

Feel free to use it if you like. Please cite and give a shoutout if you use it though.

It can also be called from my website:
